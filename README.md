![A computer rendering of clouds.](/cover_img.jpg)

This project is a sandbox in which I have been learning how to render skies with OpenGL. Current features are clouds represented by noise textures generated at runtime, with motion re-projection of pixels allowing each frame of clouds to be rendered at 1/4 of screen resolution.

Controls:

The camera can be controlled with WASD and the mouse. Z and X increase and decrease the parameter of Beer's Law. Space takes a screenshot, which is saved in the /screenshots folder.

This project involves techniques I have learned from the following resource(s), which I recommend for other curious programmers.
